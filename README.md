# Bike-store-MS-Excel-project-AlexTheAnalyst

This project is a comprehensive guide for building a Bike Store management system using Microsoft Excel, based on a tutorial by AlexTheAnalyst. It covers a variety of essential Excel functions and techniques, from data cleaning to dashboard creation, all aimed at helping users build an organized, functional, and visually appealing Excel model for managing a bike store's data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will go through the following major chapters to ensure the Bike Store dataset is properly cleaned, organized, analyzed, and visualized:

1. **Data Overview**
   - Understand the structure and contents of the data, and get an overview of the information.
   
2. **Remove Duplicates**
   - Use Excel's built-in tools to remove any duplicate records from the dataset to maintain data integrity.

3. **Find and Replace**
   - Learn how to efficiently use the "Find and Replace" tool to clean data (e.g., replacing incorrect or inconsistent values).

4. **Fix Currency Formatting**
   - Apply proper currency formatting to columns that contain financial data, making it easy to read and analyze.

5. **Age Calculation**
   - Learn to calculate the age of customers based on their birthdate, applying Excel functions to automate this task.

6. **Nested IF Statements**
   - Master the use of nested IF statements to perform more complex conditional logic within your data.

7. **Value if False**
   - Implement the "Value if False" feature in Excel to handle false conditions in logical tests.

8. **Categorization**
   - Create categories based on different criteria, such as product types, age groups, or any custom grouping necessary for your analysis.

9. **Pivot Tables**
   - Learn how to create and use Pivot Tables to summarize, analyze, and manipulate large sets of data.

10. **Adding Charts**
    - Create visual representations of your data by adding various types of charts like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.

11. **Age Brackets**
    - Use Excel's features to categorize customers into specific age brackets to analyze trends within those groups.

12. **Building Dashboard**
    - Build an interactive dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and overall store performance.

13. **Creating Header**
    - Learn how to create and format headers for better organization and presentation of data.

14. **Alignment & Design**
    - Adjust the alignment, borders, and design of your tables and charts to improve readability and presentation.

15. **Inserting Slicer**
    - Use slicers to create interactive filters for your Pivot Tables and charts, enabling better data exploration.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Excel (preferably the latest version for better functionality)
- Basic knowledge of Excel (beginner-level familiarity will be helpful)
- Data set containing relevant bike store information (this project will assume you have access to the required dataset as used in the tutorial)

## Instructions

1. **Watch the Tutorial:**
   - Begin by watching the full tutorial video by AlexTheAnalyst on YouTube:
